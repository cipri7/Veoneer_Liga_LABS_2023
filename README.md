 Intelligent Parking Lot - License Plate Recognition
 Create an Intelligent Parking Lot base on License Plate Recognition.
 The recognition will be done using Python and the neccesary libraries: opencv, imutil, numpy...see "ocr.py"
 Once the plate has been recognized it has to pass a validity check wether the number is present or not in a database.
 For this purpouse we will work with mySQL.
 If the license plate is valid the access will be granted, the parking lot gate will open(or a green LED will appear, to be seen).
 The actuation of the gate/LED will be done with Arduino.
 Connecting all the components and SW will be interesting.
 More things to come!
